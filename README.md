*This application is still a work in progress*

This application gives fans a place to contact us, keep up with our upcoming events, and leave monetary tips (normal tip or tip with song request).
It is built on an AWS backend (AWS Amplify) and React for frontend. It also uses an additional backend server with Node and Express to handle all payment processing through Stripe and their APIs.
